# underworld-assets

This repository is used to hold assets in a central place. They are automatically pulled from this repository on startup of the client file server or the game server.

Assets are either sprites made with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), or maps made with [TEdit](https://github.com/jprochazk/tedit), my Tile Map Editor written in C++.
